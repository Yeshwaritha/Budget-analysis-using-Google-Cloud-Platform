Budget analysis project explores the data life cycle under the criteria of budget recommendations, salary distributions, and departmental allocations.
The process begins with data generation and collection, followed by processing using Hadoop and cleansing with OpenRefine. 
The cleaned data is stored in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) storage buckets before being managed and analyzed with Apache Hive, Spark SQL, and BigQuery. 
Visualization is performed using BigQuery and Tableau, highlighting key insights, such as the dominance of the Chicago Police Department's budget and a balanced salary distribution across grades. 
The analysis follows a structured data-driven approach, leveraging advanced tools to ensure accuracy and clarity in budget interpretation.
